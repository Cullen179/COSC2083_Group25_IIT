					Our group topic is a financial management web application, supported for 
					personal spending and the team’s budget. For individuals, this application will allow users to keep track of their daily expenses, and payment history through visualization and comparison of spending among different periods. Based on the result, users are given recommendations to adjust their expenditure on specific categories and notified when the spending level exceeds the proposed budget. On a larger scale, regarding teams, the application would enable team managers to monitor organizational expenses, ensuring that they are within budget. In addition, team members’ budgets are distributed by the manager and their spending will be recorded for better tracking.

				<p>An efficient financial management system is a pivotal factor in business success [1]. In contrast, the failure of an enterprise is attributed to improper financial management practices [2]. Especially in Vietnam, where only 67% of consumers feel stressed about their financial situation, there is a growing demand for an effective financial management tool [3]. Thus, by using an appropriate application, individuals and teams are able to improve fund planning, utilize their financial resources,  increase their net worths and boost their economic growth. 
                <br>
                In addition, when working on a project as a team, mismanagement of the budget can cause a detrimental effect on the whole process. One member of our group previously encountered a situation where there was a deficit in the trip budget of the class. The spending on food and drinks was increased, leaving not enough budget for camping. This, consequently, caused a conflict between classmates, blaming the treasurer for not checking the total expenditure of the trip. After the unfortunate incident, he was inspired to create a financial management app for teams and individuals to analyze their spending habits and keep track of their transaction history. Thus with this app, users are enabled to improve financial planning, make data-driven investments, and increase their incomes.

                    There have been a multitude of budget management apps available in the market with the two most prevalent applications being Mint and You Need a Budget (YNAB) [4]. 
                    Mint
                    Mint is a budgeting app that allows users to keep user’s money flows under control by classifying expenses into different categories and analyzing financial habits through transaction logs and chart visualizations based on the spending trend. 
                    From the sidebar of Mint, users will be presented with their financial analysis of their expenses, investment, and loans, which will be contributed to the credit score calculator to monitor their credibility and make necessary adjustments. In addition, Mint also enables users to set their budget, and saving goals, supported by investment tips and current market trends.
                    While Mint only provides investment tips in general, Plutus can connect users with professional consultants or investors to have personalized recommendations for financial improvements.
                    You Need a Budget (YNAB)
                    Similar to Mint, YNAB users can sync their bank accounts, import data from files, or manually add new transactions. However, YNAB takes a more proactive approach, after signing up, users will assign every dollar a purpose, so it can either be spent or saved. This will allow users to get ahead of their spending for at least a month, supporting them to effectively achieve their financial goals. In addition, users are entitled to abundant resources of financial materials, both tutorial and philosophical, which will improve their understanding of how to control money flows and increase income. 
                    Plutus
                    While Mint and YNAB only provide investment tips in general, Plutus can connect users with professional consultants or investors to have personalized recommendations for financial improvements. In addition, the features of the above-mentioned apps are only limited to individual use, whereas Plutus users can collaborate with teams to have better management of the project budget and keep track of other spending activities.
