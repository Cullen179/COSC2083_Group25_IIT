					Our group topic is a financial management web application, supported for 
					personal spending and the team’s budget. For individuals, this application will allow users to keep track of their daily expenses, and payment history through visualization and comparison of spending among different periods. Based on the result, users are given recommendations to adjust their expenditure on specific categories and notified when the spending level exceeds the proposed budget. On a larger scale, regarding teams, the application would enable team managers to monitor organizational expenses, ensuring that they are within budget. In addition, team members’ budgets are distributed by the manager and their spending will be recorded for better tracking.

				<h1>Motivation</h1>
			</div>
			<div class="center_text content">
				<p>An efficient financial management system is a pivotal factor in business success [1]. In contrast, the failure of an enterprise is attributed to improper financial management practices [2]. Especially in Vietnam, where only 67% of consumers feel stressed about their financial situation, there is a growing demand for an effective financial management tool [3]. Thus, by using an appropriate application, individuals and teams are able to improve fund planning, utilize their financial resources,  increase their net worths and boost their economic growth. 
                <br>
                In addition, when working on a project as a team, mismanagement of the budget can cause a detrimental effect on the whole process. One member of our group previously encountered a situation where there was a deficit in the trip budget of the class. The spending on food and drinks was increased, leaving not enough budget for camping. This, consequently, caused a conflict between classmates, blaming the treasurer for not checking the total expenditure of the trip. After the unfortunate incident, he was inspired to create a financial management app for teams and individuals to analyze their spending habits and keep track of their transaction history. Thus with this app, users are enabled to improve financial planning, make data-driven investments, and increase their incomes.

					There have been a multitude of budget management apps available in the market with the two most prevalent applications being Mint and You Need a Budget (YNAB) [4]. 
					Mint
					Mint is a budgeting app that allows users to keep user’s money flows under control by classifying expenses into different categories and analyzing financial habits through transaction logs and chart visualizations based on the spending trend. 
					From the sidebar of Mint, users will be presented with their financial analysis of their expenses, investment, and loans, which will be contributed to the credit score calculator to monitor their credibility and make necessary adjustments. In addition, Mint also enables users to set their budget, and saving goals, supported by investment tips and current market trends.
					While Mint only provides investment tips in general, Plutus can connect users with professional consultants or investors to have personalized recommendations for financial improvements.
					You Need a Budget (YNAB)
					Similar to Mint, YNAB users can sync their bank accounts, import data from files, or manually add new transactions. However, YNAB takes a more proactive approach, after signing up, users will assign every dollar a purpose, so it can either be spent or saved. This will allow users to get ahead of their spending for at least a month, supporting them to effectively achieve their financial goals. In addition, users are entitled to abundant resources of financial materials, both tutorial and philosophical, which will improve their understanding of how to control money flows and increase income. 
					Plutus
					While Mint and YNAB only provide investment tips in general, Plutus can connect users with professional consultants or investors to have personalized recommendations for financial improvements. In addition, the features of the above-mentioned apps are only limited to individual use, whereas Plutus users can collaborate with teams to have better management of the project budget and keep track of other spending activities.

				<p>
					The aim of this project is to develop a web application for individual and team finance management, named Plutus. The application is intended to help individuals and teams better manage their finances and achieve financial prosperity. Thus, the team set out to achieve the following goals:
					<ol>
						<li>To design and develop a user-friendly interface that is easy to navigate and use, allowing users to easily track their expenses and manage their budgets. This goal is important as a user-friendly interface will ensure that users are able to effectively use the application and achieve their financial goals.</li>
						<li>To implement features such as budget tracking, expense tracking, and financial reporting. This goal is important as it allows users to have a complete view of their finances and make informed decisions.</li>
						<li>To ensure the application is secure, with measures such as encryption and user authentication. This goal is important as it ensures that users' sensitive financial information is protected and kept confidential.</li>
						<li>To test the application thoroughly and address any bugs or issues that arise, ensuring that the final product is of high quality. This goal is important as it ensures that the application is reliable and meets the needs of the users.</li>
						<li>In case things don't go as expected, the most important parts of the project are the design and development of a user-friendly interface (Goal 1) and the implementation of essential features (Goal 2) as this will ensure the team has a functional product to get early feedback from potential users. The priority should be given to these goals in order to ensure the successful delivery of the project.</li>

				<p>The project timeline is divided into 3 phases: Project Proposal, Prototype Development, and Final Reports. The first 5 weeks involved brainstorming the topic, devising functionalities, and preparing the documentation of the project. From week 5 onwards, the project will focus on structuring the layout and the design for the front-end of the website. From week 9 to week 12, we will concentrate on researching the business aspects of the project, finalizing the reports, and planning for post-production on a larger scale.

                    These are the tools and languages that are required to construct the project prototype and develop it when advancing to the project implementation stage
					Web Development Languages (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript): these are the common web development languages to build the front-end of the website. Based on the layout from Figma we have proposed, we will continue to set up an animated and user-friendly website for a better user experience. Initially, only Lam was familiar with these languages, however, despite majoring in other backgrounds, Huy and Thinh manage to get a grasp of web development after tutorial sections and hands-on exposure when building the website of the report.
					Visual Studio Code: free source code editor that is redefined and optimized for building and debugging modern web and cloud applications. Lam and Huy learned to build the basic structure of web application and take advantage of Github collaboration knowledge for further development

				<p>Testing is needed to cover all of the common errors (i.e. syntax, logical, semantic) to ensure that the project could function properly. 
				In the alpha testing, team members will represent the end users to examine if the product's functionalities could match the project scope or deliverables, then the team would clarify, and document any aspects of the system that could not meet the requirements. 
				At first, the team will promote the trial of the  project throughout the university so that the lecturers and students can evaluate the user experience to improve the better app interfaces, which are more friendly to use. In addition to usability, we seek advice from Business Department lecturers to  ensure our product will be financially supportive of those in need. 
				Any people or organization involved in the trial version would offer great help to improve the functionality and usability of the final product, and the team expects to have at least 100 pieces of feedback for effective evaluation of the functionality of the application. Thus, we can resolve any errors and bugs before the real edition. Finally, the stability of the web server will be tested against high user flow to avoid server overloading. After accumulating sufficient data, the project is ready to be published for public use.
