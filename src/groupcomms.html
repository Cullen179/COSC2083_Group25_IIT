				<p>The project team consists of four students coming from different backgrounds with different working styles. Therefore, establishing principles in communication is crucial to facilitate the project in a timely manner. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Meetings will be conducted both face-to-face and over online communication channels. All that was discussed in the meeting will be recorded in the meeting minutes following a meeting minute template.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Face-to-face meeting: an average of 3 hours per week is allocated for face-to-face meetings every Wednesday after the tutorial session and every Saturday morning at 9 AM at coffee shops. In these meetings, the team discusses the progress of each person’s tasks, and probable obstacles, and revises the timeline if necessary.</li>
                        <li>Online meeting: Aside from online meetings, the team is willing to do online calls via Teams to brainstorm or resolve any unexpected issues.</li>
                        <li>Others: the team also keeps in touch via Messenger group. Personal phone numbers are used in cases of emergencies.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    All files and documents are stored and organized online to ensure transparency and facilitate asynchronous workflow among team members via Google Drive and Github.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Google Drive: store the team’s project proposal and report, meeting minutes, and other documents during the work process.</li>
                        <li>Github: host the source code of the project and allow team members to collaborate and do version control.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The team also considers various scenarios in which a team member does not communicates:
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>When a member cannot attend a meeting, he needs to let the team know in advance. All discussed information can be found in meeting minutes on Google Drive. He can also ask other members to explain in further detail via Messenger.</li>
                        <li>When a member does not respond to messages for a week, he will be contacted via personal email and phone number if the deadline for his part is approaching.</li>
                        <li>When a member does not respond to any of the above communication, the team will reallocate his parts to other members and report such an issue to the course coordinator for further guidance.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
