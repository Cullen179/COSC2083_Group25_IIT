                    Thinh is currently in his final semester at RMIT, majoring in Digital Marketing. He has been fortunate to secure a position as a Junior Product Manager at a SaaS company in Vietnam where his team is building a business intelligence platform. In this role, he is responsible for gathering customer feedback, creating product roadmaps, and ensuring successful product launches. As a product manager, it is essential to have strong communication and leadership skills, as well as the ability to analyze data and make informed decisions. In addition to these skills, he believes it is crucial for a product manager to have a strong foundation in information technology. Understanding the technical side of product development is essential for making informed decisions and effectively leading cross-functional teams. In the future, Thinh hopes to continue honing these skills and becomes a more capable product manager, building impactful tech products that make a difference.

                    He believes individuals respect their responsibilities to complete their tasks while working as a team to deliver the products on time. Indeed, team members have the commitment to collaborate with their peers whenever an individual needs the team assistance for difficult tasks. However, the drawback of the project is our teams have difficulties defining specific technical project roles for each member from the first week because not all of us have produced any IT related products before and come up with a perfect plan. It could be improved if the members have prerequisite concept knowledge of a web application before the team formation whilst this project is an opportunity to gain one. Besides, he would emphasize that Thinh have been really conducive guiding the team especially when he summarized all the vitals content during the mock presentation session and giving effective feedback for each of us so that we can be well-prepared for the presentation day. Throughout the process of collaborating on Plutus web application, he has gained many insights into the choices of the technology stack to implement a specific product, the importance of work ethics, and building trust between members to achieve the same goal.

                    Lam is utterly proud of what the team has accomplished so far. He believes that the successful delivery of the project wouldn’t have happened, had it not been for the fruitful collaboration among team members. Specifically, the meeting minutes were of pivotal importance which covers what information was discussed, and the distribution of tasks and deadlines are noted so that we can keep track of each member’s responsibilities and manage the time for completion. That being said, since the tasks are assigned based on members’ strengths,  there are only a few opportunities for each member to expand their knowledge of different fields. This could be improved by participating in different sections besides the tasks related to their skills to expose themselves to new areas. Moreover, Lam is taken aback by Thinh’s dedication to delivering a quality project and his professionalism in organizing the meeting, contacting each member for their progress, and clearing any misunderstandings that might arise which keeps the whole team on the right track. During the project, Lam learned that all the members are very accommodating, when a member has difficulties doing a task, the other always provides support by giving advice, or sharing that task together.

                    The web application project has demonstrated well the process of implementing a web application, documentation skills on report writing, and evaluated group work ethics. The benefits of working with people from different backgrounds have broadened the project's aspect. From my perspective, the good thing while working in a group is that each team member can independently focus on different areas of research during the project. Throughout the project, the most challenging problems were that team members did not collaborate well because we do not have the same knowledge of technical skills, so there is a state that some of us need to learn new technologies in order to implement the web application. I am impressed that Lam’s programming skills have effectively saved a lot of time building a project website. Indeed, he finished the web frame within a day and explained his code well to peers so that they could understand and develop further around his main code on Github. Overall, I learned that communication skills in a group is essential as it does clarify any concerns faster than just assumptions. I believed that each of the team members did their best to have the prototype of our application Plutus successfully delivered.
