                    As the project manager of the Plutus project, I feel accomplished with the progress we made in the 12 weeks. Overall, the team was able to deliver a functional prototype that met the project requirements and was of high quality. One of the key achievements was our ability to maintain collaboration and effective communication among team members despite our diverse backgrounds. For example, we held regular meetings and utilized tools such as version control system and code reviews to ensure that everyone was on the same page. However, one area of improvement for me was time management. Despite the team's efforts, we underestimated the complexity of the required technology and did not prepare contingencies plan well. This resulted in some delays and we had to work extra hours to meet the deadlines. In the future, I will make sure to have a better contingency plan in place, and to communicate the risks and challenges clearly to the team. Overall, I am proud of the team's effort and the work we have accomplished in the given time frame. I believe that the experience of this project will be beneficial for the team members in their future endeavors.

                    He believes individuals respect their responsibilities to complete their tasks while working as a team to deliver the products on time. Indeed, team members have the commitment to collaborate with their peers whenever an individual needs the team assistance for difficult tasks. However, the drawback of the project is our teams have difficulties defining specific technical project roles for each member from the first week because not all of us have produced any IT related products before and come up with a perfect plan. It could be improved if the members have prerequisite concept knowledge of a web application before the team formation whilst this project is an opportunity to gain one. Besides, he would emphasize that Thinh have been really conducive guiding the team especially when he summarized all the vitals content during the mock presentation session and giving effective feedback for each of us so that we can be well-prepared for the presentation day. Throughout the process of collaborating on Plutus web application, he has gained many insights into the choices of the technology stack to implement a specific product, the importance of work ethics, and building trust between members to achieve the same goal.

                    Lam is utterly proud of what the team has accomplished so far. He believes that the successful delivery of the project wouldn’t have happened, had it not been for the fruitful collaboration among team members. Specifically, the meeting minutes were of pivotal importance which covers what information was discussed, and the distribution of tasks and deadlines are noted so that we can keep track of each member’s responsibilities and manage the time for completion. That being said, since the tasks are assigned based on members’ strengths,  there are only a few opportunities for each member to expand their knowledge of different fields. This could be improved by participating in different sections besides the tasks related to their skills to expose themselves to new areas. Moreover, Lam is taken aback by Thinh’s dedication to delivering a quality project and his professionalism in organizing the meeting, contacting each member for their progress, and clearing any misunderstandings that might arise which keeps the whole team on the right track. During the project, Lam learned that all the members are very accommodating, when a member has difficulties doing a task, the other always provides support by giving advice, or sharing that task together.

                    The web application project has demonstrated well the process of implementing a web application, documentation skills on report writing, and evaluated group work ethics. The benefits of working with people from different backgrounds have broadened the project's aspect. From my perspective, the good thing while working in a group is that each team member can independently focus on different areas of research during the project. Throughout the project, the most challenging problems were that team members did not collaborate well because we do not have the same knowledge of technical skills, so there is a state that some of us need to learn new technologies in order to implement the web application. I am impressed that Lam’s programming skills have effectively saved a lot of time building a project website. Indeed, he finished the web frame within a day and explained his code well to peers so that they could understand and develop further around his main code on Github. Overall, I learned that communication skills in a group is essential as it does clarify any concerns faster than just assumptions. I believed that each of the team members did their best to have the prototype of our application Plutus successfully delivered.
