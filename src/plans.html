				<p>The project timeline is divided into 3 phases: Project Proposal, Prototype Development, and Final Reports. The first 5 weeks involved brainstorming the topic, devising functionalities, and preparing the documentation of the project. From week 5 onwards, the project will focus on structuring the layout and the design for the front-end of the website. From week 9 to week 12, we will concentrate on researching the business aspects of the project, finalizing the reports, and planning for post-production on a larger scale.

                    In the first stage of the project, we were asked to devise a topic and write a project proposal from it. Therefore, we spent the first 2 weeks brainstorming ideas and holding meetings to estimate their feasibility. Although there were some intriguing ideas such as Machine Learning or Artificial Intelligence, we realized that they were too ambitious and required extensive technical skills and chose Thinh’s topic which is Financial Management App. This topic was both applicable and practical as all members used to have difficulties managing their budgets and team expenses. From week 3 onwards, we were assigned to write the proposal and do research on its further development before submitting it for early feedback. After receiving the lecturer's advice, the misunderstanding about the implementation of the project was clear and the previous schedule was rearranged. Then we held a meeting to revise the scope of the proposal and work together to come up with the deliverables of the project. Finally, we did some research to reinforce the foundation of our topic.

                    After finishing the project proposal, our group decided that we would build a minimum viable product for the project to have a better demonstration of our topic, provide a helpful financial management tool for daily, and add this project to our CVs. Accordingly, we spent week 6 doing research on the appropriate tools and languages to build a fully functional application. Subsequently, React was chosen as the web development language as it provides a powerful built-in library of Javascript to add dynamic features and interactions to the website. 
                    Lam and Huy then continued to familiarize themselves with the language by following tutorial videos online and replicating some small projects. However, they realized that getting a grasp of React in this limited amount of time is not plausible, and building a functional prototype required extensive human resources while only Lam and Huy had programming backgrounds. Moreover, with the deadlines from other courses of our team members clashing in week 6, our team held a meeting to devise a more practical approach which is constructing the application on Figma as it provides an abundance of functions to interact with the project like a functional application. 
                    In addition, Thinh had hands-on exposure to Figma during his internship and he could guide us through the process. Therefore, the first step of developing the prototype to create the wireframe of the web application, which involved structuring the layout of each page, the content divided in each section, and how the pages were linked together, was assigned to Thinh. During week 6 and 7, Lam followed the manual instruction on Figma and tutorial videos from online resources to be comfortable working with this tool. 
                    Based on the wireframe from Thinh, the team continued to create the elements on each page such as buttons, reports, navigation bar, … As the visualization required extensive use of charts and graphic design, Lam and Huy encountered difficulties creating such components according to the format. However, by searching for a similar project on Figma Community which had a colossal library of different topics, they found the desired product and replicated  the charts after it. By week 8, all the required factors for the project prototype have been done according to the deadline despite multiple hindrances.

                    In the third stage of the project, the team will finalize all the project's components including web development, group presentation, and group project report. In detail, we spent week 9 summarizing the prototype of the project by reviewing all the components on GitHub and proceeding to merge all branches to the master section after ensuring all the functionalities had worked properly. However, Lam has encountered Git conflicts when trying to merge all the necessary branches to the master branch. This happened because the code in both branches was modified by the same line, so we resolved by discussing whether to keep the current or incoming changes in conflicted files and committed to the final merge.
                    Within this period, team members worked on writing the remaining sections of the group report in these 2 weeks. In week 9, we had finished the remaining sections according to their allocated tasks and the team began to construct the group reflection according to their perspective when the process had nearly reached the final stage. When the report writing has been finalized in week 11, each member would publish their own contents of the group report to the website and commit the files on Github. In addition, Thinh and Lam were responsible to reformat the group project (i.e. fonts, structure, citations) before submission.
                    According to the presentation delivery deadline, we had planned one week ahead in week 10 to hold a meeting to discuss key ideas and sections to include in the presentation slides. Each team member made their own “pitch” script and held another meeting in the same week to prepare for a mock presentation. Therefore, each team member would gain feedback from peers and have a better performance for the presentation in week 11. 
                    Finally, in week 12, our team concentrated on formatting the final report and finalized all the content for possible flaws then added the additional sections on the website, ready for submission.

				<p>As our team's current project is in the prototype phase, we believe that with the additional time and resources, we will be able to build a fully functional web application. Based on the project prototype, we will advance to implement the front end of the application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In addition, to add the interactive features and user databases, Java and MongoDB would be applied.  Our team hopes that our product could financially support users to overcome their economic difficulties and improve their financial standing.
