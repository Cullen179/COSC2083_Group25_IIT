				<p>An efficient financial management system is a pivotal factor in business success [1]. In contrast, the failure of an enterprise is attributed to improper financial management practices [2]. Especially in Vietnam, where only 67% of consumers feel stressed about their financial situation, there is a growing demand for an effective financial management tool [3]. Thus, by using an appropriate application, individuals and teams are able to improve fund planning, utilize their financial resources,  increase their net worths and boost their economic growth.

                In addition, when working on a project as a team, mismanagement of the budget can cause a detrimental effect on the whole process. One member of our group previously encountered a situation where there was a deficit in the trip budget of the class. The spending on food and drinks was increased, leaving not enough budget for camping. This, consequently, caused a conflict between classmates, blaming the treasurer for not checking the total expenditure of the trip. After the unfortunate incident, he was inspired to create a financial management app for teams and individuals to analyze their spending habits and keep track of their transaction history. Thus with this app, users are enabled to improve financial planning, make data-driven investments, and increase their incomes.
