                    Thinh is in his final semester of the Bachelor of Digital Marketing program at RMIT University Vietnam. He has worked in the marketing field for almost two years for leading game publisher VNG Corporation alongside his study. Recently, he has decided to make a career shift becoming a Product Manager at Holistics, a self-serve business intelligence platform. It is here that his interest in data becomes a burning passion. With only a fundamental understanding of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and SQL, he wants to finish his last semester with courses from SSET to build up his IT capabilities. He takes Introduction to Information Technology as he expects to gain an overall understanding of the IT world, learn relevant terminologies, and hone programming skills from the project.
                    <br><br>
                    With real-life experience in product management and project management, Thinh is responsible for scoping the project, defining features, designing the user interface and user experience (UI/UX) of the web application, and setting project milestones.

                    Gia Huy is currently a third-year student majoring in Electronic and Computer Systems Engineering. He is interested in embedded systems because he wants to learn about electronic device components and apply programming techniques to operate the product's system. The reason I planned to study this course is to broaden my knowledge of IT topics and application in business. For related skills, I am experienced in many programming languages such as C/C++, Python, MATLAB, HTML, and CSS. Moreover, I am a detail-oriented person and I expect the project outcomes to be the best performance.
                    Huy’s role is mainly focused on analyzing errors in the code and comparing the functionality of the products with the required documents. He is also responsible for debugging and testing the program, as well as code management on Github to ensure frictionless collaboration between the team’s engineers.

				<p>The team approached this project following software development practices commonly used in the industry to manage the development of Plutus. This included utilizing an Agile approach, which emphasizes flexibility and responsiveness to change (Highsmith 2002). The team held regular meetings, such as stand-up meetings, to keep everyone informed about the progress and to identify and resolve any issues that arose. They also used iterations to deliver working versions of the software incrementally, allowing for early testing and feedback from stakeholders. Additionally, the team used a version control system to manage the source code, and they conducted regular code reviews to ensure the code met the team's standards.
                The team also practiced continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) to ensure that the software was always in a releasable state (Fowler 2018). This helped the team to catch and fix errors early in the development process, reducing the risk of costly delays or bugs in the final product.
                Overall, the team's goal was to mimic the software development process practices commonly used in the industry to ensure the development of a high-quality product.

In comparison, the planned positions across the team all shared a similarity which required technical background and they intend to continue their career in Vietnam after graduation. In contrast, there is a discrepancy in the requirements for their occupations. Thinh planned job as a Product Manager is expected to have a light knowledge of technology and inclined to management and communication skills, Lam’s profession requires data analytics skills and mathematics application, and for Huy and Quan, they are programming skills. In addition, while Huy is keen on developing hardware, Quan shows a preference for software development.
