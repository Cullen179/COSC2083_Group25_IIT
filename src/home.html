                    Thinh is in his final semester of the Bachelor of Digital Marketing program at RMIT University Vietnam. He has worked in the marketing field for almost two years for leading game publisher VNG Corporation alongside his study. Recently, he has decided to make a career shift becoming a Product Manager at Holistics, a self-serve business intelligence platform. It is here that his interest in data becomes a burning passion. With only a fundamental understanding of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and SQL, he wants to finish his last semester with courses from SSET to build up his IT capabilities. He takes Introduction to Information Technology as he expects to gain an overall understanding of the IT world, learn relevant terminologies, and hone programming skills from the project.
                    <br><br>
                    With real-life experience in product management and project management, Thinh is responsible for scoping the project, defining features, designing the user interface and user experience (UI/UX) of the web application, and setting project milestones.

                    Quan is in his first semester at RMIT, majoring in Information Technology. He has some experience with the C# scripting language, along with HTML and Python. He chose Information Technology as his major because he has had a long-time interest in game development, and a desire to make a difference in life through the use of Artificial Intelligence. He realizes the power of automation in many aspects of life - management, health, finance - and wants to improve life for everyone using easy-to-understand AI.
                    Quan’s role in this project is the front-end implementation of the web application using HTML, CSS, and Javascript and using relevant Python libraries for data visualization.
                    Alongside the above responsibilities, all team members participate in writing the project proposal, report, and presentation slides to communicate with external stakeholders.

                    Lam is in his second semester in Information Technology so far, minoring in Data Analytics as he wants to delve deeper into Machine Learning and Data Manipulation. Not until he realized the influence of technology and how it manipulates our 24/7 life did his passion for Computer Science thrived, not wanting to be left behind in the ever-changing digital world. In terms of skills, he has accumulated the foundation of 3 programming languages: Python, C++, and Java, and web deployment languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
                    For this project, Lam also oversees the project scope, features, and implementations. Furthermore, he looks after the web application database and backend management thanks to his previous exposure to working with data.

                    Gia Huy is currently a third-year student majoring in Electronic and Computer Systems Engineering. He is interested in embedded systems because he wants to learn about electronic device components and apply programming techniques to operate the product's system. The reason I planned to study this course is to broaden my knowledge of IT topics and application in business. For related skills, I am experienced in many programming languages such as C/C++, Python, MATLAB, HTML, and CSS. Moreover, I am a detail-oriented person and I expect the project outcomes to be the best performance.
                    Huy’s role is mainly focused on analyzing errors in the code and comparing the functionality of the products with the required documents. He is also responsible for debugging and testing the program, as well as code management on Github to ensure frictionless collaboration between the team’s engineers.

				<p>The team approached this project following software development practices commonly used in the industry to manage the development of Plutus. This included utilizing an Agile approach, which emphasizes flexibility and responsiveness to change (Highsmith 2002). The team held regular meetings, such as stand-up meetings, to keep everyone informed about the progress and to identify and resolve any issues that arose. They also used iterations to deliver working versions of the software incrementally, allowing for early testing and feedback from stakeholders. Additionally, the team used a version control system to manage the source code, and they conducted regular code reviews to ensure the code met the team's standards.
                The team also practiced continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) to ensure that the software was always in a releasable state (Fowler 2018). This helped the team to catch and fix errors early in the development process, reducing the risk of costly delays or bugs in the final product.
                Overall, the team's goal was to mimic the software development process practices commonly used in the industry to ensure the development of a high-quality product.
