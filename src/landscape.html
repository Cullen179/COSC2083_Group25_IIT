                    Mint is a budgeting app that allows users to keep userâ€™s money flows under control by classifying expenses into different categories and analyzing financial habits through transaction logs and chart visualizations based on the spending trend.
                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    From the sidebar of Mint, users will be presented with their financial analysis of their expenses, investment, and loans, which will be contributed to the credit score calculator to monitor their credibility and make necessary adjustments. In addition, Mint also enables users to set their budget, and saving goals, supported by investment tips and current market trends.

                    Similar to Mint, YNAB users can sync their bank accounts, import data from files, or manually add new transactions. However, YNAB takes a more proactive approach, after signing up, users will assign every dollar a purpose, so it can 
                    either be spent or saved.

                    <br>
                    This will allow users to get ahead of their spending for at least a month, supporting them to effectively achieve their financial goals. In addition, users are entitled to abundant resources of financial materials, both tutorial and philosophical, which will improve their understanding of how to control money flows and increase income.

				<p>While Mint and YNAB only provide investment tips in general, Plutus can connect users with professional consultants or investors to have personalized recommendations for financial improvements. In addition, the features of the above-mentioned apps are only limited to individual use, whereas Plutus users can collaborate with teams to have better management of the project budget and keep track of other spending activities.
