            In a real-life application, our project will be supported for 2 main use: individual   tracking and team collaboration. 
            <br>
            For individuals, the anxiety of not knowing where all the money is spent and the constant decrease of the budget is alleviated by using our application enables users to store all the transactions that users have made on the Transaction page including the description, type (income, saving, expense), category of the transactions and the amount. In addition, users can identify their financial problems of overspending and high frequency of transactions by viewing the spending amount and frequency throughout the whole year on the Reports page. Moreover, users can devise solutions on where to cut down the cost based on the category proportion. Finally, the lack of financial awareness from users on how to optimize their incomes and decrease expenses can be amended with our application by providing business news, financial tips, and tricks so that users can overcome their economic difficulties.
            <br>
            In terms of teams, the worries of overspending from team members and unknown loss of budget are mitigated in our application, enabling the team manager to control the expenditure of each member by viewing all the transactions detail that is made by the whole team in the Team Transaction. In addition, the team can pinpoint the root of their financial difficulties from the contribution level from the Team Statistics, identifying who has the highest transaction amount and who makes the highest quantity of transactions. Moreover, the team can decide on which section cost needs cutting down based on the category proportion of where the budget is spent on.

            <emp>Development phase:</emp>Development phase: Our team has designed the prototype for our Plutus website application which allows potential stakeholders and investors to get a grasp of the structure of our products and how to interact with different functionalities inside our application. 
            <emp>Functionalities:</emp> Due to time and resource constraints, our team has decided to focus only the primary functionalities of the application that can facilitate users to have better management of their budgets and expenses. Initially, our team planned to include some features that allow users to create an account, sign in, and collect feedback from user experience, which eventually had to be dropped.
            <emp>User Interface:</emp> The current interface of our prototype is still not attractive and user-friendly. Thus this can discourage usersâ€™ engagement to improve the management of their budgets ad expenses and user experience when having to manually input all the transactions detail.

          <p>
            In the future, with more time given, our team will be able to resolve the current restrictions with our project and deploy a fully functional web application. First, some missing features that allow users to create an account, sign in, and send feedback about their experience when using our application, will be included in the project. In addition, an AI model will be developed to gather users' transactions from their bank accounts and bills, cutting down the time needed to manually input the details. Then, we will add some engaging features to motivate users such as a reward points system or titles when they made strides in raising their financial conditions. With all the features defined, using HTML, JavaScipt, and MongoDB, our project will be implemented as a fully functional application.
