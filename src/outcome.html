            In a real-life application, our project will be supported for 2 main use: individual   tracking and team collaboration. 
            <br>
            For individuals, the anxiety of not knowing where all the money is spent and the constant decrease of the budget is alleviated by using our application enables users to store all the transactions that users have made on the Transaction page including the description, type (income, saving, expense), category of the transactions and the amount. In addition, users can identify their financial problems of overspending and high frequency of transactions by viewing the spending amount and frequency throughout the whole year on the Reports page. Moreover, users can devise solutions on where to cut down the cost based on the category proportion. Finally, the lack of financial awareness from users on how to optimize their incomes and decrease expenses can be amended with our application by providing business news, financial tips, and tricks so that users can overcome their economic difficulties.
            <br>
            In terms of teams, the worries of overspending from team members and unknown loss of budget are mitigated in our application, enabling the team manager to control the expenditure of each member by viewing all the transactions detail that is made by the whole team in the Team Transaction. In addition, the team can pinpoint the root of their financial difficulties from the contribution level from the Team Statistics, identifying who has the highest transaction amount and who makes the highest quantity of transactions. Moreover, the team can decide on which section cost needs cutting down based on the category proportion of where the budget is spent on.
