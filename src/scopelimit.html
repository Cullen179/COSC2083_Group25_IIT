				<p>This project is initiated for finance management, allowing users to oversee their daily transactions and keep track of their spending level by using data visualization and statistical analysis. By using this app, they will be able to make more data-oriented decisions to reach their goals and measure the growth of their net worths.
                For this web application, there will be two main supported users: Individual and Team manager. Individual users will have access to expense supervision, and saving support services. The team manager, whereas, will have further permission to allocate financial resources to the team and monitor team members' activities.

				<p>Development phase: The project is still in the early stages in which only the prototype of the application is completed. The prototype of our project is built on Figma which can enable the potential stakeholders and investors to understand the structure and the functionality of our project, simulates the website interaction with pages, buttons, and visualization of the charts and comparison with the given data.
                <br>
                Functionalities: In terms of the features of our application, our team has decided to concentrate on the main functionalities that support financial management due to the limited time given. Therefore, some planned side features, which allow users to create an account, sign in, and send feedback about the experience when using the application, were dropped.
                <br>
                User Interface: The current interface of our prototype is still not attractive and user-friendly. With more time and human resources, our application can be improved by adding entertainment components to attract user engagement such as reward points, and titles when users make an advancement in their financial standings.
