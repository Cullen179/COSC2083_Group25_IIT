				<p>The team needs to cover all of the common errors (i.e. syntax, logical, semantic) to ensure that the project could function normally. In the alpha testing, team members will represent the end users to examine if the product's functionality could match the project scope or deliverables, be prepared to clarify and document any aspects of the system that could not meet the requirements. In the early stage upon completion, the web application will be released as trial mode to the public so that online community platforms can provide any flaw detection before the main launch. At first, the team will promote the trial products throughout the university so that the lecturers and students can evaluate the user experience to improve the better app interfaces, which are more friendly to use. Additionally, the products will be suitable for those who in need of financial management service or a business use for financial group managing purposes. Any people or organization involved in the trial version can help us to improve the functionality and usability of the final products, and the team expects to have at least 100 feedbacks to effectively evaluate the functionality of the application. By doing this, we can receive feedback from trial users and resolve any errors instead of focusing on any flaw assumption. Other than that, the stability of the web server can be tested when the high capacity of users accessing the application to adjust the server overload. After accumulating sufficient data, the team will attempt to deploy the web application and resolve any further bugs.
